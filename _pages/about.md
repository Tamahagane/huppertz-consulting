My name is Manuel Huppertz and I have a passion for data, maths and building the right tools for the job. On these pages I will take you on a tour through some of the things I created in the last few years and some of my musings and experiments in the data science field.

I work as a freelance consultant and you can hire me if you need an IT project manager, digital marketing specialist or data scientist.  

If you want to contact me, check out my [main page](http://huppertz-consulting.de).
